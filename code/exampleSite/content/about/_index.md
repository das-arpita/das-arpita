I am Arpita Das. While growing up and getting schooled in Assam, I had always been keen to do things differently. One of them would be going away to Chennai for my Under Graduation (B.Tech) from Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, for studying Leather Design. No one from my family had ever pursued, let heard of being a designer. With all design learning and product designing at NIFT, as time went by, I became more of a problem solver. It got into my understanding much later but that is what design is right? Solving problems. 

Being curious has kept me through my passion for User Experience Design and Film. So, here I am a self-motivated individual with an extremely versatile skill set. I find my self as a flexible team worker, reliable, and possess excellent time keeping skills. Also, I am very keen to improve my knowledge and skills in these fields.
